  "alchemancy.entry.blazebloom": "Mysterious Flora",
  "alchemancy.entry.blazebloom.page0": "During one of my expeditions through The Nether, I came across this peculiar flower growing near a pool of lava. It's warm and oily, capable of emitting a faint glow when planted on Netherrack or a Flower Pot, quite distinct from anything I've seen growing in the Overworld. Due to its warm nature, I believe a suitable name would be $(item)Blazebloom$().",
  "alchemancy.entry.blazebloom.page1": "Like a warm day at the beach.",
  "alchemancy.entry.blazebloom.page2": "So far its oils have served me well as a great source of ink for writing this book. However, I believe that there may be more to this mystical plant. Perhaps I could gather some form of extract by boiling and distilling it in a $(item)Brewing Stand$().",
  "alchemancy.entry.blazebloom.page3": "I wonder what it tastes like..?",

  "alchemancy.entry.alchemancy_forge": "Alchemical Breakthrough",
  "alchemancy.entry.alchemancy_forge.page0": "My experimentation with $(item)Blazeblooms$() has lead me to the discovery of a strange new substance, it's as vibrant as it is corrosive and most certainly NOT safe to ingest. The heat it emits has increased exponentially, and no longer requires any form of soil to generate, my guess would be that this is due to its exposure to Blaze Powder.",
  "alchemancy.entry.alchemancy_forge.page1": "After some more experimentation, I had accidentally spilled some of the extract onto an $(item)Ender Pearl$() I had on my desk, causing it to shoot out an intense beam of energy that mutated a wall of Stone it collided with! A nearby stash of $(item)Emeralds$() also seemed to have reacted to the beam, vibrating as if they were atracted to it.",
  "alchemancy.entry.alchemancy_forge.page2": "Could this be some new form of crafting? Or perhaps an undiscovered facet of Alchemy? All I know is that I might have some ideas to put it to good use.",
  "alchemancy.entry.alchemancy_forge.page3": "By utilizing some vials of Extract and an Ender Pearl as a lens, I have managed to create a device capable of firing beams of Alchemical energy on command... sort of. In order to stabilize the device's structure, I had to fit the vials of Extract underneath my lens. And thanks to the unrelenting power of gravity, I am unable to safely pour Extract onto the Ender Pearl.",
  "alchemancy.entry.alchemancy_forge.page4": "I am most certainly not concerned about this setback, as I have discovered that large quantities of specific gemstones appear to pull in and react to the Alchemical Extract, so a $(item)Block of Emerald$() above my device with a gap in between should be more than enough to run some tests. All that's left to do would be to give the device a click to get it started.",
  "alchemancy.entry.alchemancy_forge.page5": "It may not be portable, or weaponizeable, but it should get the job done.",

  "alchemancy.entry.transmutation": "Item Transmutation",
  "alchemancy.entry.transmutation.page0": "After activating the $(item)Alchemancy Forge$(), all of the extract stored inside of it was consumed and transfered to the Block of Emerald, converting it into an astonishing new crystal! This crystal seems to radiate intense energy, the same created by pouring Alchemical Extract onto an Ender Pearl. And it appears to generate it as well, so I shouldn't need to worry about refueling it.",
  "alchemancy.entry.transmutation.page1": "Activating the crystal with a right-click or a redstone signal shoots out beams of Alchemical energy down to the forge, so placing an item on top of it should allow me to safely convert it into something else. I have dubbed this process $(thing)Transmutation$().$(br)$(br)After experimenting with the forge for a bit, I managed to discover a handful of transmutations. The following pages will detail a handful of my discoveries.",
  "alchemancy.entry.transmutation.page2": "Transmuting an $(item)Ender Pearl$() appears to yield results different to simply pouring extract onto it. It appears as if the pearl has lost all of its \"$(property)Ender$()\" properties, leaving nothing but a blank husk behind. Perhaps it could be refilled with some other type of energy...",
  "alchemancy.entry.transmutation.page3": "Bizarrely, transmuting a blank book creates an exact copy of my notes, what kind of cosmic joke is this? Does this prove the intervention of a higher power?",

  "alchemancy.entry.infusion": "Item Infusion",
  "alchemancy.entry.infusion.page0": "During one of my experiments, I decided to an additional $(item)Alchemancy Forge$() and attempt to transmute it to see what happens. To my surprise, the Alchemical energy seemed to have reacted to the machine's components, imbuing it with a similar, yet unique form of energy that faintly radiates from the lens.",
  "alchemancy.entry.infusion.page1": "This energy appears to make any items sitting on top of it be drawn to an adjacent beam of Alchemical energy, the effect only lasts while the item is in direct contact with the irradiated energy, and goes away the instant the item is removed from this new device.",
  "alchemancy.entry.infusion.page2": "If an item is transmuted while another is being pushed in by the pedestal, it merges the two together, seemingly appending the properties of the pedestal item onto the one being transmuted. I believe Transmutation isn't the right name for this process, perhaps \"$(thing)Infusion$()\" might suit it better.",
  "alchemancy.entry.infusion.page3": "With some tinkering I have managed to adjust the forge to give me more control over the Infusion process. Now it no longer attempts to infuse or consume items that may result in... unfavorable... effects. Aside from that, Infusions will now occur in a clockwise order starting from the front of the forge, and will start with the \"recipe\" that requires the most ingredients.",
  "alchemancy.entry.infusion.page4": "To recap, Infusion Pedestals can be placed next to or at a diagonal of an $(item)Alchemancy Forge$(), placing an item on a pedestal will attempt to infuse it into the center item when the Crystal is activated. One item for each pedestal will be consumed at a time, and the infusion will try to perform as many \"recipes\" as it can until one of each available item has been consumed.",

  "alchemancy.entry.lead": "Lead",
  "alchemancy.entry.lead.page0": "Alchemists of old would strive to convert base metals, such as lead, into precious gold. Nowadays $(item)Gold Ore$() is fairly common to comeby, so perhaps the opposite could be done to convert it into Lead. Transmuting a $(item)Gold Ingot$() seems to yield a result so similar, that it might as well be used and classified as a common $(item)Lead Ingot$().",
  "alchemancy.entry.lead.page1": "Perhaps due to the transmutation of gold's high enchantability, or simply thanks to its radiation-shielding properties, Lead seems to be completely immune to both transmutation and infusion processes.",
  "alchemancy.entry.lead.page2": "Lead Ingots however, can still be infused onto other items, scrubbing off any Infusions they may have. Perfect for salvaging failed experiments.$(br)$(br)Ingots made from this type of lead can also be crafted into tools and equipment, maintaining the metal's immunity to infusions, making them great for warding off unwanted Infusions that could somehow make it into my equipment. ",
  "alchemancy.entry.lead.page3": "Even if this immunity is seen as a drawback, Lead shares similar attributes to iron when it comes to equipment, having identical defense, damage, and mining efficiency. But something they don't share in common is their durability: Lead equipment is 4 times more durable than its more common counterpart, one could even consider it an upgrade if short on diamonds.",

  "alchemancy.entry.dreamsteel": "Dreamsteel",
  "alchemancy.entry.dreamsteel.page0": "My travels through The Nether have lead me to another discovery: an alloy the locals seem to refer to as $(item)Netherite$(). This metal excels at the creation of tools and armor, and has some latent magnetic properties. But as fascinating as this may be, I can't help but involve this discovery with my latest research. As a result, I will attempt to $(thing)Transmute$() one of these Netherite Ingots.",
  "alchemancy.entry.dreamsteel.page1": "The results were astounding: the Transmutation process had turned my Netherite Ingot into something I could once only experience in my dreams.
